# RecBole-DA

**RecBole-DA** is a library built upon [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole) for reproducing and developing data augmentation for sequential recommendation. 

## 1）Highlights

* **Easy-to-use API**:
    Our library provides extensive API based on common data augmentation strategies, users can further develop own new models based on our library.
* **Full Coverage of Classic Methods**:
    We provide seven data augmentation methods based on recommender systems in three major categories.

## 2）Implemented Models

Our library includes algorithms covering three major categories:

* **Heuristic-based Methods**: CL4SRec, DuoRec
* **Model-based Methods**: MMInfoRec, CauseRec
* **Hybird Methods**: CASR, CCL, CoSeRec

## 3）The Team

RecBole-DA is developed and maintained by members from [RUCAIBox](http://aibox.ruc.edu.cn/), the developer is Shuqing Bian ([@fancybian](https://github.com/fancybian)).
